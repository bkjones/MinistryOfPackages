A (not-finished) PyPI server implementation using Tornado. 

This is being put here now so I don't lose it. I have serious doubts about my
laptop at time of writing. :) 

I'll update this doc when this is actually usable. Promise. 


It requires Redis, redis-py, and Python 2.6.x (I'll test w/ 2.7 going forward as
well). 

I'm after a few different things with this project: 

1.  I want something that's blindingly easy to deploy. I don't want to muck with
    WSGI, CGI, FCGI, whatever. I want to write code and run it, and have something
    that works. Having used Tornado for numerous other projects (some 'web scale'),
    I can tell you it works :) 

2.  I want some enterprise-y features like proxy requests and package caching.
    Those will come later, but I didn't want to start this using a huge
    multi-headed framework because I want to get to them sooner than later :)

3.  I want to understand distutils, Python package distribution, and all that
    stuff better.

At time of writing (Nov. 24, 2010, 2PM EST), this project supports simple
Apache-style directory listings, and the setup.py 'register' and 'upload'
commands. It's all incomplete though, because the data model needs to be
properly implemented, so you'll see 200 replies and nothing happening. I'm
testing with distutils and setuptools/easy_install in Python 2.6.
