Each package has a hash that can be looked up using 'pkg:<pkgname>'. The
hash contains all of the arguments received in a setup.py 'register' or
'upload' request. These requests are handled in handlers.SetupPy.py.

For each PyPI 'classifier', there exists a Redis set named
'classifier:<classifier_name>', which contains the names of all packages with
that classifier. This should make it easier to filter on classifier in a
search/browse interface.

For each non-classifier argument that comes in, a Redis set exists or is
created named 'metadata:<argname>' which contains a list of as yet unidentified
values. Perhaps the idea was to hold each unique value for that particular
piece of metadata. So, for example, 'metadata:author' would have a list of all
known authors of all known packages. I'm not sure this makes one bit of sense,
I'm just going by what's in the code.
